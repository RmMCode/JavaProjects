I made a custom PacMan game in JavaFX using the principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and Swing.      Players can navigate their PacMan through a maze, collecting food, power pellets, and cherries while avoiding the ghosts that are also circling around the maze.                                                                        The game has features such as portal teleportation, ghost AI, pause/reset button functionality, and level completion messages.
