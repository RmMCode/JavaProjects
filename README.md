I am currently developing Games using JavaFX to apply the programming skills and concepts I have learned throughout my Freshman Year.

Code Descriptions
1. WhackAMole: A fast-paced clicking game where you can earn points by hitting moles while avoiding hitting the dangerous piranha plants. The game tracks your score and displays a high score that constantly updates as you get a higher score.
2. Calculator: A fully functional calculator built using JavaFX. It supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value (modulus), square root, percentage, trigonometry, and more. It provides a clean interface that is styled to resemble a physical calculator, alongside the additions of real-time button interaction and display updates.
3. I made a custom PacMan game in JavaFX using the principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and Swing. Players can navigate their PacMan through a maze, collecting food, power pellets, and cherries while avoiding the ghosts that are also circling around the maze. The game has features such as portal teleportation, ghost AI, pause/reset button functionality, and level completion messages.
