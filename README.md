I am currently developing Games using JavaFX to apply the programming skills and concepts I have learned throughout my Freshman Year.

Code Descriptions
1. WhackAMole: A fast-paced clicking game where you can earn points by hitting moles while avoiding hitting the dangerous piranha plants. The game tracks your score and displays a high score that constantly updates as you get a higher score.
2. Calculator: A fully functional calculator built using JavaFX. It supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value (modulus), square root, percentage, trigonometry, and more. It provides a clean interface that is styled to resemble a physical calculator, alongside the additions of real-time button interaction and display updates.
